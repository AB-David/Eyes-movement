# MIT xPro Project ðŸ’»
This is one of the projects I was working on to get my professional certificate in Full Stack Development by MIT xPro. 
If you are curious about this rigorous program you can learn more about it [here](https://youtu.be/5CiCtj_2Qsg).

## Real Time Mouse Movement tracker 
This will track the user's mouse pointer movement. Move your cursor around the screen and watch the eyes follow your movement! This fun experience was made mainly by using CSS and Javascript to manipulate the eyes movement. It is not limited to just 2, any number of eyes can be added. 

# *Demo*

### *Usage*: 
1. Use JavaScript to set the web page styles
2. when the page is loaded, enjoy moving the cursor around while the 'eyes' will follow your movement on the screen. 

### *Roadmap*
Will add more detail to the 'eye' to give it a more realstic feel. As a Harry Potter fan I hope to add more eyes in the future and turn it into the Harry Potter 'Monster Book of Monsters' cover. (The cover of the book has multiple eyes that follow the movement across the cover)
